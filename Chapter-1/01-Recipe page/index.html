    <!-- Ordered list for step-by-step instructions -->
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the stem part of the tomato and pepper into a cap shape.</li>
        <li>Remove the seeds inside the peppers and wash them.</li>
        <li>Remove the seeded part of the tomato. Chop the pieces you cut and the ones that come out of the tomato into small pieces to add to the minced meat you will fry and keep them aside in another plate.</li>
        <li>Mix the minced meat and let it cook in its own juice first.</li>
        <li>After cooking for 15 minutes, add the butter and fry and add the diced onion. Then add the pieces of tomato and pepper and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the last 5 minutes, add the mixture of finely chopped basil, coriander and dill and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut the stem part of the eggplants and cut them in half, salt them well to remove the bitter water.</li>
        <li>After 15 minutes, wash them and cook in oil until the inside softens and all sides are lightly browned.</li>
        <li>After the eggplants are browned, place all the vegetables on a tray.</li>
        <li>Add a small amount of salt, pepper, cinnamon and plum paste to the vegetables and mix well with your fingers. Place a basil leaf inside each vegetable.</li>
        <li>Fill the vegetables with the minced meat you prepared. Chop 1 tomato and 1 pepper into small pieces and add them to the tray (you can also add 50 gr butter according to your taste).</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven at 180 degrees for 40-45 minutes. Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
